To add an antivirus service for checking file uploads in Laravel, you can follow these general steps. Please note that the actual implementation may vary based on the antivirus solution you choose. In this example, I'll use the ClamAV antivirus scanner. Make sure you have ClamAV installed on your server.

1. **Install ClamAV:**
   Install ClamAV on your server. The installation process may vary depending on your server's operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install clamav
   ```

2. **Install the Laravel ClamAV Package:**
   There is a Laravel package that integrates ClamAV into Laravel. Install it using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require frogbob/laravel-clamav
   ```

3. **Configure the Package:**
   Add the service provider to your `config/app.php`:

   ```php
   'providers' => [
       // ...
       Frogbob\LaravelClamav\ClamavServiceProvider::class,
   ],
   ```

   Publish the package configuration:

   ```bash
   php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Frogbob\LaravelClamav\ClamavServiceProvider"
   ```

   This will create a `config/clamav.php` file.

4. **Update Configuration:**
   Open the `config/clamav.php` file and configure the ClamAV settings according to your server setup.

5. **Create a Service:**
   Create a service that will utilize the ClamAV package to check uploaded files. You can create a service class like `AntivirusService`:

   ```bash
   php artisan make:service AntivirusService
   ```

   In `app/Services/AntivirusService.php`, you can define a method to check a file:

   ```php
   <?php

   namespace App\Services;

   use Frogbob\LaravelClamav\Facades\Clamav;

   class AntivirusService
   {
       public function scanFile($filePath)
       {
           return Clamav::scanFile($filePath);
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Usage in Controller:**
   Use the `AntivirusService` in your controller to check uploaded files before saving:

   ```php
   use App\Services\AntivirusService;

   class UploadController extends Controller
   {
       public function store(Request $request, AntivirusService $antivirus)
       {
           // Validate file and check for virus
           $request->validate([
               'file' => 'required|file',
           ]);

           $file = $request->file('file');
           $filePath = $file->getRealPath();

           // Check for virus
           if ($antivirus->scanFile($filePath)) {
               // Virus found, handle accordingly
               return redirect()->back()->with('error', 'File contains a virus.');
           }

           // Save file
           // ...

           return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'File uploaded successfully.');
       }
   }
   ```

   This is a basic example, and you may need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements and the antivirus solution you choose.

Remember to thoroughly test your implementation and consider adding additional security measures depending on your application's needs.
